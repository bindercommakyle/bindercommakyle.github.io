I am a 6th year Ph.D. student at Ohio State studying algebraic and tropical geometry, matroid theory, and combinatorics. My advisor is Eric Katz.

Recently I've been thinking about problems relating to:
1. How the geometry of hyperplane arrangements is reflected in the associated matroids.
2. Cohomology of toric varieties and minimal free resolutions of Stanley--Reisner rings.
3. Intersection numbers in the chow ring of matroids.

I am on the job market this year.

Here is my [CV](https://bindercommakyle.github.io/files/cv1014024.pdf).
