I am a 6th year Ph.D. student at Ohio State studying algebraic and tropical geometry, matroid theory, and combinatorics. My advisor is Eric Katz.

Recently I've been thinking about problems relating to:
1. How the geometry of hyperplane arrangements is reflected in the associated matroids.
2. Generalizations of the Matroid Chow Groups introduced by Adiprasito, Huh, and Katz.

I am on the job market this year.

Here is my [CV](https://bindercommakyle.github.io/files/cv7-11-2024.pdf).
